;;; gtd.el --- Simple GTD helpers -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Provides GTD daily logging functions for managing `gtd.org`.
;;
;; Main features:
;; - `my/gtd-insert-today': Create/jump to today's headline with customizable
;;   sections (default: Routines, Notes, Summary via `my/gtd-daily-sections')
;; - `my/gtd-weekly-review': Show current week entries (ISO week-based)
;; - `my/gtd-last-week-review': Show last week entries
;; - `my/gtd-time-reports': Generate clocktable reports with tag aggregation
;; - `my/gtd-open': Main entry point bound to C-c G
;;
;; All daily headline operations are idempotent: if a headline exists,
;; the function will jump to it rather than creating a duplicate.
